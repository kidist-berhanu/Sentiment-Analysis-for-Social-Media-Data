65,"One of my most enduring video game memories is from the original EverQuest. I had started a new job doing tech support for dialup internet and had made acquaintances with a few of the gamers in the office. 

EQ was the first real MMO I had played, and everything was larger than life. I had no context for anything I was seeing. I had created a dwarf warrior I think it was and Dave from the office met up with me on his high level wizard. He brought me to North Ro, outside of Freeport.

We teleported to the spires there which was amazing and really captured the imagination. But what really stood out were the giant scarabs. I had no idea what they were except they were enormous compared to my dwarf. Dave--I wish I could remember his character name--casually blew them up in one shot and then even beat one to death with his staff.

I have a ton of other really great EQ memories, but that's the earliest and most dear. The sense of wonder and scale from that time has rarely been fully recaptured since then.

Thanks, Dave!",positive

172,"Story time.

I was very good at halo going into uni. I was the best on campus, and no one else was very close for the first year or two I was there.  At the start, people would just come in and watch me play MLG matchmaking or customs with my other good friends.  Many of them wanted a shot, so we would play 2s-4s on matchmaking, and I would let them ruin my rank, so I could build it back up for them to ruin again.  Eventually, there was enough interest that we had 8 guys who wanted to play.  

We had enough interest, so we played LANs. We would set up two CRT tv's in different two rooms and connect them with an Ethernet cable through the hallway.  At the start we would have to scrap to get 8 people to play, pounding on doors and pulling guys from their girlfriends.  Sometimes we played 2v2s or 3v3s, but NEVER anything but true MLG rules.  

My team would literally never lose if I was playing full on, so I played lazy most of the time so it kept the games fairer.  I would give up snipes/shotty/rockets everytime to let everyone else practice.  I would even pretend to have homework, pass the controller, and coach one team while I ""wrote a paper.""  

These were my boys.  After a few months, my boys got very, very good.

By the end of our freshman year, we had 10-12 guys every night playing competitive games.  We would play in my dorm from after dinner til one or two am.  There was ALWAYS someone in my room, on my xbox, even if we weren't LANing.  We even had four upper classmen who were on sports teams (they lived in different dorms) challenge our best four.  Then I played full on. There were around ten guys watching these games, and I got a few killtacs.  One memorable killtac was on Ascension and it was a full chamber, four headshot sniper killtac.  The room exploded and kids ran from my room to the other room just to trashtalk in the middle of the game.  They lost around 10 in a row before they left without saying good game. The upper classmen wouldn't let me play against them anymore, but they loved having me over to carry them in BTB or whatever shit they played. 

Sophomore year started and a new batch of freshman came in.  This added six more guys.    An upperclassman transfer heard about us, so he joined.  He was as good as I was, so we were always team captains to keep games balanced (he might have been a bit better than I was, but I would never tell him that.  He was the pointguard for our school's basketball team and absurdly cocky at the time. We would later become roommates and he was in my wedding).  At this point, we had far too many people and we had to figure out ways to get everyone a chance.  Bottom two +/- players from each team passed the controller.  At around this time, I no longer had to play lazy, and some of my friends that were shit at the start were outperforming me.  It got to the point where we had 6-8 guys who were close to the same skill level.  We could make very competitive teams, and my Junior year, it had gotten very competitive.  We would have halo drama complete with fights and shit. That was good fun too, because then I could take the training wheels off and talk trash a bit too. 

We ended up sending a team of four to MLG Columbus in the early 00's.  We did not do great (shocker, I was a big fish in a little pond), but we played very respectably during scrims with other teams our level.  It was an amazing experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.  These guys are now my forever friends, and, in retrospect, I laugh at people who told me I would regret playing video games so much in uni.",positive

My dad got me into video games with the original DOOM and DOOM 2. I remember always calling him upstairs to help me find the exit or to beat a certain area/boss.

One day I called him up, but he looked confused. For the first time ever, I was further along in a game than he was. Soon after, *he* started calling **me** upstairs for advice, and I taught him the cheat codes to have more fun.

That was the beginning of the end of his gaming career, unfortunately. Work and family duties kept getting in the way, so not long after the PS2 he stopped playing video games with me and my brother. He'd always loved racing and beat-em-up games. He rocked racing but sucked at fighting, though when he spammed Law in Tekken he was unbeatable.

Fast forward 20+ years, and my mum decided to buy him an old Xbox360. He loves it and tries to play, but he missed out on so many advancements in video games that he just can't keep up. He still loves hearing me talk about them and showing them to him. He lost his freaking mind watching me play DOOM 2016 when he came to visit my son recently, it was wonderful to see.",positive

495,"I always enjoy teaching ppl how to play games. It's often the case in Roblox whenever there's a game that has a level-up system, it's almost explicitly required for higher lvl players to help lower lvl players. There's always the troller, of course, but whenever I join a game and theres high-tier players willing to help, it's such an enjoyable experience and then, once I meet them up in the big leagues, I join their ranks to help others. I've seen it mostly in the Infinity RPG game. Feels good the whole time.

Edit: Well, at times it's hard to teach when there's skill involved. Manual mechanics, like in Overwatch or ESO, may be harder to help translate for a new player. It's often like trying to teach someone a language you just learned in my opinion. 

Sometimes it's just *your* language or ""behavior"" that makes you good with the character you're using. You develop it to where it's no longer just you telling yourself what to do, but it eventually becomes instinct. Teaching a new player is basically ""dumbing it down"" again. I've seen it have repercussions on the teacher at times.

Eh, it's still worth it in the end, because then you've got someone who plays like you, so playing together becomes that much more fun and easy. Hopefully. I know some ppl still take their own behavior into it and play their own way anyways...",positive

At the time I was doing some casual dark souls 1 any% speedrunning (and was just jumping into it back then after years of self-imposed challenges to spice things up). Cue the ""whoa wtf"". By the next week him and a few of our friends were all watching me do a run (IIRC about an hour and a half and some change, so nothing record shattering or anything, even now I'm nowhere near those 30-some odd minute madmen.)

Next thing i know I'm showing half of them how the different mechanics behind some of the glitches work, how to casually fight some bosses out of a speedrun, ext. Soon my friend who brushed off dark souls now wanted to give it a go... cue the death montage for a while, but eventually he was getting the hang of it. Had to help him with a boss or two at first, but now I'm looking at his steam profile and he's got a solid 100+ hours on DS1 and he's planning on jumping into 2 and 3. We even got another friend or two into the meat grinder and now we all have fun chatting it up. As for me I've kinda given up speedrunning it. It's fun but just not something I see myself doing, at least for dark souls. I think I was approaching sub 1 hour, but getting those tricks down... just damn man mad respect for the top speedrunners.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",positive

She and I went on to make a guild together that killed the Lich King on Heroic, but before that, we got married in Hamburg.

She loved to be the Heavy in TF2. Most of the time I dealt with the spies. I swear the Bonesaw has a higher crit chance than other meme weapons. If we were defending, she went Engineer and I went Pyro. I airblasted people into her sentries so she'd get the kill.

The first time she used Omnislash in FF7, she squeaked and held her palm up to her mouth. We played 9 and 10, too. I refused to even let her try to get the 0:00:00 chocobo race time, but I got it for her reasonably shortly.

We played Dark Souls 1 and 3 together. She beat the Iudex Gundyr on her own after some coaching from me, but anyone will tell you that's still a serious accomplishment. She refused to kill Sif... I said that she was just another Undead that lost to Sif and her game ended there. 

I've advised and explained dozens of systems in MMO's alone... Spent at least 10 hours coaching her on being a good healer, a good DPS, a good player...

I didn‚Äôt like that I had to mine for stone, chop wood, keep myself fed or from being thirsty so that I could keep my health and stamina up. None of it made sense to me.

Then my best friend and my husband coached me through certain features, and why it built tension and suspense. How at the core of a survival game, it could have the same ‚Äúfun‚Äù stresses of a RTS game in many ways, but without the need for controlling multiple units.

After their patience and explanation, I was hooked. We‚Äôve had 5 LAN parties (and we‚Äôre in our mid-thirties,) and long weekends just to play Rust, and I have over a thousand hours in it. I‚Äôve followed development since then, through the rebuild and large changes, reading every development update, watching every fan made video about patch notes, best ways to build or stay alive, etc.

We made the run from Wetlands to Ironforge and every few seconds a crocodile would aggro me and chase me.

1727,"Wow‚Äôs an odd beast because the serious end game content does not really resemble the experience of getting to that end game content. I think they have it balanced because there is a lot of daily quests at the end game that is basically the experience of leveling. But the end game itself, joining a guild and hopping on discord to organize for a major raid battle, is a very different story from collecting apples and killing boats. 

And it‚Äôs interesting because the game doesn‚Äôt really have like a ‚Äòmain gameplay loop‚Äô. You could say the main loop is your ‚Äúrotation‚Äù which is a synonym for loop. In long fights, raids and dungeons, you have your powers and abilities that you rotate through using as the moment becomes most optimal to use those powers. But most fights during quests as you level are not anywhere near long enough to use your full rotation. And of course you don‚Äôt have access to all of it unless your max level. 

The main ‚Äúloop‚Äù such as there is in WoW is about upgrading your character to be as powerful as possible. but it‚Äôs not really a loop as much as a constant progression forward as there are a large number of ways to become powerful. And more, there are distinct versions of being powerful. Theres PvP, or you can sit back and fish, or level up in cooking or archeology, or blacksmithing or alchemy, or do pet battles. You can do daily content, either current or old, to get titles and mounts and transmog options for your armor. And of course you can try and power up your Item level as high as possible to become powerful that way. 

Literally anything you do in WoW marks progress to some goal that improves your character in some way, and really only a tiny fraction of the latest high end content will put you in the, for lack of a better term, ‚Äúmain gameplay loop‚Äù. It‚Äôs a great game. But I wonder how many other genres there are where the end game is a remarkably distinct experience from the rest of the game.",positive

1934,"Some ""gamer girls"" create themselves ‚úåüòé‚úåüéÆüî•

Okay, but seriously, gamers are gamers regardless of gender. Gamers are not inherently male simply because the majority of video games today are violent. We gals don't just vent frustration by shopping, applying makeup, etc (at least **I** don't...); sometimes we need something violent with guns to blow off some steam. Give me a hammer of any kind and I promise you, shit's gonna get REAL *real* quick.

I don't even like the term ""gamer girl"" because it reinforces the lie that ""games are for boys"". I'd be worse off if I had been told that and forced to play with JUST toys or something. Granted, I grew up with two step-bros so I automatically got used to video games as a whole. But before that change happened, I was playing the Dreamcast as my first console, and kiddie PC games.

Just like toys can be enjoyed by either gender, video games can too. Yes, games and toys alike have a target audience but it doesn't always mean that the intended audience will pick up on it. I mean, look at My Little Pony and how HUGE it got with the male persuasion. I do think that there are things that should stay with whom it was meant for but not everything HAS to be labeled blue and pink; sometimes, things are purple. üòä",positive

I still play a few games with them, we do have some similar tastes. It's mostly games where you can play in very different ways. I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming.

It was my first mmorpg but we essentially played it like an mmo, and I didn‚Äôt experience any of the rpg. Now in later expansions that we play together, I‚Äôm still on a beeline to max level so we can get straight to the late-game action. I‚Äôll be done with a quest before him and he‚Äôll ask, ‚ÄúHow did you finish reading the dialogue so fast?!‚Äù Simple, I didn‚Äôt.

I just kept dropping him new weapons and armor because I was so excited about progressing, but it just wasnt any fun at all for him since he had no idea where all his gear was coming from, and now he won't touch the game :(.

Had a much better experience playing WoW with a different gf (now wife).  She had played a little before, which helped, and because it was just the two of us I just sat back and let her decide where we went, what quests we did, if we did any dungeons or anything, and tried to minimize on the ""telling her what to do"" side of things.  Let her come to me with questions instead of piling on a bunch of useless information (meaning no context yet) she didn't need.  Played a tank so she could have fun killing things.  It went much better.

It's helpful to remember that when showing someone a game, it's supposed to be because you enjoy it and it's supposed to be because you enjoy spending time with that person.

I RUN AT HIM ROTATING MY EPIC FLAIL ABOVE MY HEAD WHILE SHOUTING INSULTS AT HIM! ONE HIT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO NUKE HIM!""
GM says: ""k, roll the dice""
Dude gets 1s in every single dice, an epic failure.
GM: ""...well you start dashing at him, shouting and taunting looking great. Mid run you trip on a rock, miss a swing and smash your head in with your the ball full of spikes of your awesome flail in an epic display of gore, arrogance and incompetence.

I love surgical strikes, being as quiet and unseen as possible, killing everything without ever being caught once (always sniper or rogue types), and stealth levels/games are my jam.

You ever consider that some people don't play 20+ hours of a game when they don't like it? Would you do that? I know I wouldn't. Not to mention, the industry is rigged against journalists. As if they have enough time to play games for as long as the average consumer does. They're expected to review every major release in the brief period of time between when they're given a review copy and the game's launch, just so a bunch of jackasses can come over and tell them they're doing their job wrong. Why don't you try it? Clearly you would do so much better in the same situation. 

People give a lot of undue hate to journalists and make assumptions about them as a collective based on a few bad impressions. I don't go to IGN for reviews, it's true, they're not that great, but they're not a hive of terrible people who are trying to antagonize their audience.

2428,"To be fair, carrying a new player is probably the worst you can do in Warframe.

You have to give them a feel that they are doing stuff themselves as well and it is not just you speedrunning levels with some AoE damage stuff that kills everything instantly. Ideally you take some stuff like a bow and stuff like the Lex as weapons so that you are not able to kill everything instantly. Take a good melee weapon in case you need to clear a lot of stuff quickly. You should really take your time and slow roll it a bit until they get into it. Don't rush it and go with their pace.

Of course you could also taxi them to Hydron and level their stuff in no time but then they will never touch the game again.

Excalibur is still the best starter frame imo, almost no mod requirements and you can have a good impact and kill stuff pretty quickly even as a new player. Volt and mag have less impact early on I would say.

Also change things up often, Defense and Survival missions are probably the worst you can do to a new player.

2585,"you didn't really understand what i was saying. i'm not saying fuck positivity. neither am i saying that there is something wrong with things that make people happy and remember good things.

what i'm talking about is people choosing to deal with their feelings of inadequacy or incompetence through pacification. pacification is the wrong way to deal with these feelings. when you play a game and suck ass, you feel like shit for a reason: that reason is because you care about being good, you care about not being someone who sucks ass. the right way to deal with it is to get better and change yourself to become someone who doesn't suck ass anymore. when you instead pacify your feelings, you're just fucking up your own system you have for caring about things. 

it's like this: you're measuring a temperature using a thermometer, and it measures a temperature you don't like, you decide to have the thermometer falsely read the temperature you want instead of changing the actual temperature. same thing: your feelings tell you this situation sucks, instead you pacify your feelings so you feel alright instead of getting better. it's a form of self-delusion. true positivity in this case is becoming better. so i don't think positivity sucks, positivity rules.

the reason you call it positivity is probably because you buy into this bullshit in our culture where positivity = pacification of negative feelings. ""it's ok! you can do better next time!"" <-- people say this is positivity, but this is pacification because of ""it's ok"".  it's taking your own feelings of ""this fucking SUCKS"" and turning it into ""it's ok"", neutralizing it. that clearly isn't positivity because negative to ok is like going from a negative number to near 0. ok things aren't positive, they're just ok. and ""you can do better next time!"" people say that shit all the time even when they don't know that someone knows how to do better next time. so, that's a lie, isn't it? so why do they lie? well because their aim isn't to make you better, it's to pacify you. and pacifying requires you to believe lies.

true positivity is ""this is how you do it"" or ""this is what you need to do to become better"". you respect what a person wants and show them how to achieve it.",negative

Definitely burned out a time or two.  

Finally progressed the story enough to get to the origin of the tenno and things like that, unlock some newer mission types, some warframes that actually warrant a significant change in playstyle, etc, and stuff suddenly got way better.  It was still the same gameplay loop, but it just feels sometimes like the first chunk of the game is ""do the same 4 mission types on slightly different terrains,"" without a lot of context or relation to the story beyond ""these guys bad, tenno good.""

Against my better judgement, I decided to be nosy and rudely go ask if they just got engaged, instead of letting them have their special moment. They confirmed that they just got engaged and they actually expressed excitement that I witnessed it and they invited me to their in-game wedding [Ceremony of Eternal Bonding](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/eternalbond/na/), which apparently is not a cheap digital purchase ($40, $20 per person) and they get a limited number of guest invites.

I thanked them for the invite and since I was fairly new to the game at the time and I thought they were joking about the wedding and invite....then about 30 minutes after I left them to their own devices, I got a notification that I have a message.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables.",negative

The best part of him was that he'd never give a positive review because he got paid to review - if he ever got paid to review at all, I assume not since it would be a conflict of interest.

That and he'd go into as much detail as possible. Review sites like IGN that get paid for reviews (which of course they've been exposed as one of many) are just trash and unhelpful. 

They also rate games out of 10, and inconsistently at that. I can't name any off the top of my head but there are games that are outright trash compared to another, but score an overall rating higher than the better game.

And from there you need to implement some registers, and the CPU architecture, like can you do math on a memory address or do you need to load and store to do math on a memory address, from this point you need to design your pipeline, and then you need to implement the following operations: compare, and, or, not, xor, add, subtract, load, store and jump/goto/branch, and a conditional jump/goto/branch. And then you will have a turning complete CPU, just hook up some memory and a way to read the outputs and, you would have a programmable computer in minecraft, and if you exclude the add and subtract operations of the CPU it would theoretically be one of the more simple cups you could make, you could go super risc and have only a not and an and operation along with the non alu operations for the simplest computer in minecraft.",positive

I never raided nor grinded gear very much, but still had loads of fun up until I quit at the end of Cata/reveal of MoP.

Whereas Neverwinter tired me out before I even reached the level cap, it was so boring and repetitive at the end. It was pretty fun in the early game, interacting with some of the D&D mechanics and such, but each area was the same shit with a different skin, dungeons too.

The only other MMO RPG I've really loved was a 2¬ΩD called Dragonica. It had a ridiculously high skill ceiling, which made it pretty fun repeating content, trying to outdo your personal best, become more consistent, learn new tricks and techniques, etc. Unfortunately I think Dragonica is super dead at this point.",positive

You level without noticing it, and when you go into PVP or WVW (server vs server) they automatically put you at max level and scale up your gear so it's a more even field. Also, the community is great.

But it's also unreasonable to expect a typical reviewer to sink that kind of time into a single game just for the purpose of a review.

I think in these cases specifically, if you're telling me that a reviewer can't adequately tell you what you need to know from a game in a reasonable amount of time, then you might want to just consider not putting weight into those reviews.

Also, can you give me an estimate of how long it would take to max out a character?

Plus, it's completely elitist to say that someone can't have an opinion on a game without squeezing every single drop of content out of it. 

To me, what it looks like you're doing is making up reasons to say someone else's opinion is wrong. Don't throw a hissy fit just because a critic has a different opinion than you. Criticism shouldn't just be about validating the opinions of people who already love something, it should be an honest appraisal.

Have the corner block be removed (still stuck in but so a minecart can pick them up through the wall. Drop a villager in and wait for it to get turned. Have the minecart track that leaves from that corner and  have a fork in the track so you can send the zombie back into the tube and the other way sends them to the trading hall. From there cure them and place down a lectern (if you want enchants). Note sometimes a glitch hapenes where the librarian decides to untrade themselfs so ALWAYS have the stuff to buy the books (couple of emeralds and books) because once you buy from them they are locked but before you make that first trade, if you back out to go grab your stuff to trade they might lose that trade you wanted

If you guys want a vid I can make one since this is my own design based on things I‚Äôve seen different people do. I have not seen one do it this way, the closest I‚Äôve seen is Ph1lza does this but doesn‚Äôt realize zombie villagers that you make do the same thing.

I‚Äôll probably make the vid tomorrow or the next day once I finish it myself because my old world deleted itself so I had to start over

Edit: forgot to mention that villagers only take on trades during certain times of the day

Edit 2: should also give advice on getting emeralds. With this technique not many emeralds and needed so the farmer isn‚Äôt needed. This is mainly because the librarian sells 3 bookcases for 1 emerald after you cure them. 1 emerald buys you 9 books than sell those books back to the same villager for 1 emerald for 1 book or something close.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

3309,"Triple-A actually started as a marketing term that is similar to blockbuster. They have high budgets, tons of marketing and published by mid- to major publishers. They are usually extremely polish, take less risks and have major oversight from the publisher. Unlike indies where they have smaller budgets, low initial marketing (may increase after release) and published by a small publisher or even an individual. These games usually are stylized, take a lot of creative risks and don't answer to a publisher (and as a result don't usually get funding from one). There are increasingly higher budget indies with newer and better technology becoming available to the masses wielding a not as widely used title triple-I (triple indie) where an indie game will have higher budgets and look amazing (like No Man's Sky) but lack a major publisher. 

With the increasing availability of niche marketing and entertainment, it is getting quite harder to tell what is blockbuster and what is independent these days, especially once an independent game gets big and is acquired by a publisher or becomes something big such as LoL.

In the end it is a very informal and loose term and everyone's definition is slightly different but the three main keys stay the same: Was the budget high ($60+ million, usually into the mid to high 100 millions)? Was the game widely marketed (on internet sites, television, newspapers, food products?) Is the publisher a major publisher (EA, Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo to name a few)?

I think what makes TripleA is the scale of company, We all have objectively selected companies that when we hear about them creating a game we expect it to be triple A.

To name a couple off the top of my head, Rockstar Games, Capcom, Santa Monica Studios.

What constitutes AAA for me however, is quality.

A perfect example is Warhammer Vermintide. It has an intriguing story, an AMAZING world to build off, the combat is 10/10 the best melee combat you‚Äôll find and its also the next generation thing for L4D, cause that‚Äôs its essential construct that it‚Äôs based behind L4D.

It‚Äôs a game that should be AAA, but isn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not popular...

I also think sales affect what we think is AAA, mostly Editions, if a GOTY edition comes out, does that make it triple A? Maybe.",positive

3480,"> You clearly don't know

No, I do, I've been here since alpha and admined multiple servers, made plenty of machines and farms of all sorts.

""Oh wow honey yes you are!"" but people in the game are all painfully aware that the ratio of folk who discover groundbreaking new exploits and farms to those who look up exact step by step instructions online with zero effort or creativity is like 1:10,000, lol.

But that's all beside the point anyway. Cheating is never justified or not by whether it was hard to cheat... it's still wrong to cheat whether hard or easy.

SINGLE player, every playstyle is valid, and mojang creates a lot of content for crazy shenanigans there.

MULTI player, the game needs tlo be fair per server. Getting an edge over all your fellow players by abusing glitches is straight and simple cheating. No two ways about it, no different than swiping money from your brother's pile in monopoly while he goes to the bathroom. Unless your server admins explicitly condone this.

I think that the beginning of an MMO matters a lot, and should be enough to make a player want to continue playing, otherwise, why should they dump buckets of hours into the game? It's like someone trying to watch an anime that's supposed to be great, but there are like 300 episodes before it gets good.

3826,"I lol'd, but then realized I should add - those controllers are really useful for tons of stuff besides bleep-blooping on your Playtation 5. You can bleepbloop that controller with (usually) minimal effort to a Windows PC or Raspberry Pi, for example, or you can connect to other devices via the provided USB port.

I currently use a Playstation 4 Dualshock bluetooth'd into a Raspberry Pi 4 in my living room that doubles as a home theater PC and cloud-gaming access point using Steamlink - so the games are actually processed on my personal computer in my room with the video feed and input/output tunneled to the Pi via LAN. This was shockingly easy to set up (I'm a nerd but not an especially capable one) and the Dualshock is a total champ for all of the above purposes. I'm guessing the extra input capabilities of the PS5 controller will work just as well on other platforms, just as the big center-button ""touchpad"" and internal gyro of the DualShock 4 are both *fully* functional on my raspberry pi (they literally control the mouse cursor in the OS, how badass is that?).

As a sidenote, the Steamlink is alarmingly capable - so far it has run all of the games I have attempted on similar quality settings as when I sit at my actual desk, and I don't even plug my computer directly into the router - it's just on the typical WiFi \~5.4 Ghz signal with about \~150 mbps of throughput on average, by my testing... then the pi is Cat 6'd into the router direct, gigabit/sec ethernet port... and running AAA games from just a few years ago at 1080p, 60 hz on our home television is not only tolerable, it is downright passable, with total additional input/display latency typically hovering around a very manageable \~100 ms. Obviously not ideal if you're a competitive street fighter player. Single player whatever, it's almost unnoticeable.",negative

And it wouldn't be complicated at all, PS4 already has a built in controller overlay where you could map and reassign whatever buttons you need, so developers wouldn't have to do anything. Just remap buttons on the system level and that's it.

I don't know your parents and how they would take some friendly teasing over their tech illiteracy.  


The second reason I would do it though is educational. I can easily see mom doing this to one of the young grandkids under 10 years old. And they likely wouldn't find it nearly as amusing as I would. We actually had someone give my nephew a 3ds(used) along with some games but not bother also gifting a charger. Kid was kinda disappointed about the fact that once the battery was drained there was no way to play his game. I ended up giving him my old one when he asked to borrow it one day when he was over. I didn't really use my 3ds anymore and unlike a young child without a credit card/online payment abilities I can easily order a new one if I end up wanting to play it again for nostalgia sakes.

Another thing is that a lot of games don't natively support the PS5 controller. I used my DualShock 4 for Cyberpunk 2077 (without modifying the controls) and I got on-screen PlayStation button prompts. The DualSense can't do that yet.

XBOX One controllers, for example, require torx security bit screwdrivers and soldering.

7168,"##REMOVED CONTENT##
I have replaced all my content with this comment.
Reason for this is the anti-community attitude, dishonesty and arrogance of the reddit CEO /u/spez",negative
7169,"In some ways I suppose, especially for screen prompts. But there are other advantages as well.

First off, as a frequent person on the steam controller sub reddit where we also help people with crap related to any pad they're trying to configure with Steam's software besides steam's own one, I've been seeing an increasing number of Xbox pads NOT working right out of the box with wireless. This is pretty preposterous for MS of all people. (Though sometimes fixable with a firmware flash on the pad, which can't be done wirelessly and some people don't have a cable for it)

But as far as features go, the PS5 one will also have the advantage of the gyro if you can get a game to use it the way you want to anyway, and the touch pad. Steam's pad tools can alter what any of these (and the rest of the pad) do. I'm not sure what else they added support for on there, I know the PS4 ones you could change the light bar color too.

As for the gyro, people like to knock gyro but it's actually really exceptional on 2 hand pads when using it for higher accuracy combined with another movement method for bigger movements. Admittedly though, this is extremely good on the Steam Controller, think mileage is gonna vary more on anything where your main movements is with a right stick though, as Steam's touch pads are just excellent for camera movement via mouse, what can I say.

That is why I say your mileage will vary with gyro though. You'd want to combine it with right stick, and I dunno how well that'd go, in comparison. Also, some games freak out with 2 stick inputs for one stick. Others, you could just make the gyro mouse, or could make the stick mouse and gyro mouse in steam and it'd mesh better, if the stick doesn't feel shitty. I guess I could probably go on about the options in that software all day though lol.",positive
7170,"That's such an incredibly minor reason, it takes me an hour of playing tops to get used to the wrong Xbox prompts again, and support for PlayStation ones has gotten a hell of a lot better and will likely continue to do so.",positive

It sounds silly but the rumble feedback when the wheels lock up under braking was really a game changer for me when I switched to a first gen Xbox One controller.

Secondly, you are absolutely correct. The playstation controllers have more functionality. But that functionality really isn't used for the vast majority of PC titles.

Most PC titles are going to be ports of xbox titles.

Then they told me that just had never been able to find the Wii but they promised as soon as they could they would get it for me. Of course I was fine with it. We always went to our grandparents house (who lived a few hours away in a different state) on Christmas morning and I opened all my gifts there, more Wii stuff. Then they had me take out the trash, and the recyclables went in their shed, well I open the door to the shed and the Wii was sitting there, my grandpa had drove 6 hours to a best buy to get one and split the cost with my parents.

Big roguelite veteran here. I've 100%ed Isaac, RoR, RoR2, Rogue Legacy, and I'm pretty close on Necrodancer.

I've played Nuclear Throne, BPM, Gungeon, Wizard of Legend, Streets of Rogue, Noita, Wildlands Ghost mode, Diablo Hardcore mode, and Children of Morta pretty extensively. Permadeath is my jam.

I only recently got Hades, and I'm on my 16th consecutive win out of a total of 18 wins (increasing heat, of course) - I got my first win in a pretty average number of tries; maybe around 50? After that and a couple more losses, It all kinda clicked, and it's become fairly easy. Now I'm playing for the unlocks/prophecies/plot.

I tried M&K early, but much like Isaac, Gungeon, Morta, Noita (which I play with M&K), and Rogue Legacy, avoiding hits is far more important than dealing heavy damage, so a controller gives more granularity for movement. You can only move in 8 directions with M&K and only at one speed, so that's why I use controller. There have been dozens of situations in which I would have been hit if I didn't have it. Yo do lose the aim precision, but the aim assist in the game is quite intelligent and feels very nice. There have been a half dozen or so times where I wanted to aim for a trap rather than an enemy, and it gets in the way then, but otherwise, I think controller is superior.

I might prefer left thumb controller, right hand mouse, but I haven't seen any devices that manage to make that feel nice, unfortunately.

Point bean, I think you're hamstringing yourself by playing with M&K.",positive

So you would either need to bind the gyro to mouse-like joystick (which isn't as good but works fine in some games), or bind every control to a keyboard and mouse input. Thankfully with steam input, you just have to import a configuration if you do the second option.

So the reply is completely stupid. Except maybe the last part. That's fair. Trying to remember which button is which can get confusing unless you are used to it.

So I made the switch. Well, and I'd just like to emphasize that this is just *my opinion*, totally NOT the case with the Steam controller. I actually really like the Steam controller for certain games, but the [lack of a proper joystick on the right hand side](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Steam_Controller_B.jpg/1200px-Steam_Controller_B.jpg) made combat extremely difficult to navigate around quickly and keep control over where I was looking. Especially when the auto-lock-on-enemies ""feature"", or whatever that is, was on. It's possible I was doing something wrong or just not able to get used to it but even after several hours over a few sessions, it still didn't feel smooth or intuitive at all, and left me feeling very very frustrated.

For example, obviously there's a binding to turn 180 degrees, but the bigger problem was doing things closer to 90 degree turns or trying to swing your camera around during combat. There is no way to change any sensitivity settings (at least not that I could find, playing on PC), so it required multiple swipes of the right Steam pad to make turns like that. Whereas with a regular joystick you just hold it in the direction you want in various degrees.

Again, I recognize that maybe I was just not able to get used to it or just needed to git gud, but I actually switched back to M+KB and didn't look back. I changed a few key bindings and completely turned off the auto-enemy lock setting, after that I didn't even remember why or how it felt clunky in the first place. Felt natural, easier, and solved the issue I had using the Steam controller. I finished my playthrough on M+KB and loved every second of it.",positive

Even years later, in the time ocarina of Time came out on the 3DS. We always called each other when we get stuck, and thought together on how to progress. A few months before the next Zelda game came out she passed away very suddenly. She was 66, healthy as far as we knew. Full of life, really.

If you get really, really used to this and haven't had much time with a mouse, trying to switch to a mouse feels over sensitive and twitchy.  If you try and fall back on your old habit of lining up your shots with movement rather than aiming, the binary input of the keyboard suddenly becomes a limitation vs the analog input of a stick.

This works very well with games that offer proper cover. Without cover, offense is king, and the inferior aiming of the controller makes some games unplayable for me.

Do you have proof? Because from my personal experience they are the same. It‚Äôs worth noting that I use Bluetooth over wired because wired actually has more Latency than wireless.

When DS4Windows works it worked just the same as steams config. I‚Äôve heard there is a better fork of DS4Windows that is more consistent. But I just don‚Äôt need it, since I don‚Äôt get noticeable input lag. 

I have my setup in a different room and added a wall jack for usb and hdmi by my pc and by my living room tv and have a usb to usb plugged into the wall and hdmi. Then have my tv plugged into the other side of the hdmi wall slot and a Bluetooth dongle plugged into the wall on the other end of the usb to usb.

That way even though my PC is upstairs I can play games on the couch comfortably. And I‚Äôve been using steam config for 2 years now and have played a lot of dark souls and challenge runs on dark souls. Any noticeable input lag would likely have gotten me killed in those games.

In all your experience, did you actually measure it? 

Did you have to download a driver when you setup your Steam controller? No? So it's in-between, not at the driver level.

10492,"Ok, so this game is written with a very cool new type of engine from what I have been able to gather from playing the ever-loving shit out of it.

It writes the story as you play based on what you do, see, and hear as Arthur.

To that end, you can re-write chapter 1 to be a bunch of different scenarios depending on what you do. Failing a chekpoint 3 times lets you skip it, and the narrative extrapolation algorithms fill in the blanks on their own. Following roads helps.

Turn off auto-save, save your game, then start a new one. I think it might be important that you have 2 different save files, but more data on that would be nice.

Some of the options I have found:

Making it look like Arthur was out all night looking for John

Playing murder investigator with Dutch and Micah

Having the Adler house sequence be Sadie's dream where she substituted Arthur for her husband

An actual party going on at the Adler house (no idea how that one happened, but I think you need to rush there and have you, Dutch, and Micah arrive at the same time)

And the default O'Driscoll fight

I am sure there are a lot of other scenarios waiting to be written.

It is important which frame you skip the opening text on for deciding your group's starting alignment.

Skipping parts of the opening cinematic can save both Davey and Jenny.

To save Davey you need to skip the wagon scene at the right point and the next scene after Ms Grimshaw sets up camp, but before Abigail notices he is dead.

I haven't been able to figure out what saves Jenny, but got her to be alive in about 1 scenario out of 10

Skipping the dialogue for any point at which Dutch is mentioned as leader, as well as making ***good*** decisions makes you the leader of the gang by default.

The front page of your journal has a gang roster, which jobs you pulled and with whom, and your earnings/gang savings from each job.

For best possible results train up your stats during chapter 1. Running in the snow is the best way to train your stamina, and you can level up your melee skills during the O'Driscoll barn ambush by repeating it. It makes life a lot easier later on.",positive

10906,"I‚Äôve been around horses since I was little so I don‚Äôt really know how to explain it but RDR2 just has horses that *feel* right. It‚Äôs not just about the proportions which is what a lot of games miss. I‚Äôll try to explain it tho!

Imagine a big, tall, buff football player running. There‚Äôs kind of a way someone like that would carry themselves. Now imagine a chubby toddler running but moving in the same way. It‚Äôd be weird, right? Horses are the same way. If you have a big draft horse, it‚Äôs not going to move like a small Arabian.

Check out [this](https://youtu.be/hZzlnbmQ7rk) video of a draft horse in RDR2 (skip to like 7:35). You can kind of feel the weight it has. [Here](https://youtu.be/uYDBi_YlAZw) is a video of an actual Belgian Draft Horse running around. You see how the horse in RDR2 carries itself in the same way?

Another example, an [actual Arabian ](https://youtu.be/excnkRguWeM) vs one from [RDR2](https://youtu.be/fpYyMwjQvq4) (6:15). Same kind of movement.

I‚Äôm not sure if that helps‚Ä¶ but to me watching the horses in RDR2 just feels right. And the actual models looks great. Draft horses are big and bulky, with thick necks and legs (like the Belgians, Shire horses, and Ardennes). Arabians have a very distinct look, being a bit slender and having very distinct eyes (if that makes sense). 

Here‚Äôs some pics of horses I know vs the same breeds in RDR2, this might be more helpful than the videos: https://imgur.com/a/3WR2JLZ

It's a good read. And don't worry too much about the late reply, my phone was off for the majority of my being awake so I probably would have read it later. Either way, you needn't apologize for anything. 

In regards to the game, I see exactly what you mean. It's not so much they ""got the breeds right"" per se, at least maybe not down to a T, but mannerisms, presentation, and essentially how they ""walk the walk"" make give the variety of horses genuine authenticity. Maybe they nailed each breed, I wouldn't know, but I've definitely noticed the uniqueness with how each individual horse carries themselves. It's the answer to the question I kept asking myself, wondering if there was something wrong with the game/video when the person I was watching switched horses and they moved different. 

I'll check out the links when I can see well from both my eyes compared to my current mediocre cyclops vision. I'm very interested to see what's behind them and it just may start occupying my free time so I'll be sure to watch the entirety of the video(s). Also, I can relate to your ""feeling right"". It isn't/wasn't something that was taught to you straightforward (or maybe it was) but the fact that you're so used to it helps in discerning the differences/nuances between each horse which may very well add to the immersion.

Now that I'm married it's a whole different thing. When guys find out I'm a chick and tell them I'm married suddenly is HIGHLY offensive to them.

11087,"As a psychologist I find these interactions between male and female gamers very weird. They very often have this outlook that the men saying these stuff are toxic or manipulative, and the girls are victims of this approach. What I often see is that these men have very little social skills. They try their best to get in touch with these girls, whom they view as strong, desirable and competent, in a way that they think is good. 

Some of them have really learnt that Mario(no joke) and Link are good role models. Not because they are depictions of how men actually behave, but because a lot of these boys and men have lacked a proper positive masculine role model in their real life. They use what they know. A man or boy being overly chivalrous, to a point where it‚Äôs weird even, is probably doing so because he has a very positive view of the girl he is talking to. And in his mind being kind and a good man(hero) for this girl means being chivalrous, coming to her aid, like Mario or Link(especially link is a very relatable character as he is brave, handsome and strong). To me this is nothing to make fun of. It‚Äôs rather very sad to see these boys and men try their best to reach out to someone they view as highly positive, and are left being made fun of and misunderstood. 

And make no mistake about it - you girls are viewed as positive! Some of these men might be weird, make you feel uncomfortable, some even toxic making gestures or approaches that is highly inappropriate. Being a girl meeting these men(online) is often difficult and very taxing because the men are lacking social skills that creates a good atmosphere. Since it‚Äôs the girls who know better in that situation they are the ones that finds it most uncomfortable. But, almost all the time their approaches and behaviour stems from them viewing you as positive. Not just attractive, but positive. Girls are viewed as kinder, emotionally smarter, easier to talk to, safer. A girl is a good friend too, and a lot of these men are missing that. Like they are sitting alone in the sandbox in kindergarten. And when they are weird, they are trying their best. When they ask if you have a boyfriend it‚Äôs their best attempt to find out if they can move closer or not. If they are toxic it‚Äôs because they often are angry that they are missing the positives a girl represents in their own life. Girls are in this story so much stronger than these men. 

It is these men‚Äôs responsibility to mature and learn other ways to talk to girls, especially online. But it is so important to understand where these boys and men are coming from, to see the value they put on to you women. It is a sadness to see posts like this, because it makes it clear how these men are perceived. Them reaching out and doing their best comes across as weird and toxic. Imagine how much they struggle to get in touch with people, girls in particular. Imagine how lonely they are. 

In my experience knowing where a behaviour comes from makes handling the impact of that behaviour a lot easier. Understand that a toxic man is being so because he finds what a woman represents unattainable. It‚Äôs a positive excluded from him. Downgrading female gamers is his way of dealing with that loss. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care anyway, I don‚Äôt need a girl in my life, they suck!‚Äù. Now he can believe that he can be okey without. Try to notice that dynamic, and see if you can feel some compassion for how isolated some of them feel. If you do, the toxic man is shown for the sad boy he feels to be, and his comments no longer as threatening.",positive

She used to have a ""girly"" name and would constantly get mansplained to, regardless if she was playing well or not having a great game; didn't matter, she would have to be told what ""she should really be doing as a supp"". The day she changed her name to a man's name (literally ""Jim""XYZ) no one said anything to her. I mean NOTHING, no ""hellos"" let alone monologues of advice, so as long as she didn't talk it was allll good.


Flashforward to Apex being huge and crossplat: We were playing trios with and rando so her and I were just shooting the shit over game comms (since I was on PC and she was on Xbox) when the rando starts vomiting advice. Her and I being in the same room just looked at each other as this guy ranted, completely unprompted, about how Apex is best played, about how Octane (the champ she was playing) should be used, about how many games he's won, etc. I've literally never listened to something that cringey first hand, but the fucking cherry was him offering to give her lessons.

11341,"From a woman's perspective, here's a few ways to help shut down this behavior as a guy:

Speak up when a guy starts talking like this to a woman. If you don't speak up, you're a slient participant letting this toxic mentality continue.

Stop making any jokes about gamer girls, even satirically. Sarcastically saying over the mic ""are you a giiiirrrrrrlllll"" is still going to be harassing them. Even making a bunch of gamer girl jokes not directed at a particular person still makes us feel like we can't speak. It. is. not. funny. Sarcasm should be saved for people you really know, not strangers.

If you have to pretend a girl gamer is a guy to treat them like a person, you need to reevaluate your inner prejudices. If you don't know how to interact with a woman online, look at how you should interact with women, or really any human, IRL.

It's crazy how hard it is for a lot of men and boys to be kind. If you think you're kind but still do these gamer girl jokes and harassment, check again.

If a woman needs help in-game, she'll ask for it. You don't need to rescue her or be her protector unless the game actually calls for that. If you wouldn't offer the same help to a guy, don't offer it to a woman.

We need to get to a point where we don't even use the term ""gamer girl."" We're really just all gamers.",positive

Most would at least feel happy to have women go out of their way to try to make them feel welcomed. 


Are we also seriously going to ignore the fact that most women still have an overwhelmingly negative attitude towards gaming, or nerdy hobbies/men in general, and that men shouldn't be surprised or enthralled when they find something that is still relatively uncommon? More evidence to this is how common it is for women to try to shame or attack nerdy guys for trying to express any kind of attraction towards them, effectively shaming them for having desires or feelings because they are men/nerdy.

11530,"Difference is, most guys would be into that. 

We're a sexually dimorphic species with the females evolved to be more selective than the males (males can reproduce multiple times a day, women can only do so once a year. This means women who are more selective with a more limited resource were more successful in reproduction over human evolution). 

Not saying a guy isn't being a dick by talking to female gamers that way, they definitely are. Just saying this kind of misses the point by assuming if the tables were flipped a guy wouldn't be into sexually assertive females most of the time. It's one of the reasons those assholes in construction sites justify catcalling. They think, ""Well, I would like it if a girl shouted that I look strong"" without realizing or really even considering that just because the average guy would like that doesn't mean the average girl does.

EDIT: Downvote all you want, I'm not going to avoid the awkward truth of how actual biology works just so people feel better. Men and women act and behave differently overall for reasons more than just nurture. Doesn't make one better than the other, just different in some areas on average. Sorry if that offends some of you, but maybe at some point you can get over the lie that we're all identical automatons and get to a point where you can celebrate the areas we are different because those specializations are what made our species survive and thrive. Stop being afraid of what makes us different, it's just as ignorant as the bigots that hate what makes us different. Accept and celebrate.",positive

Back in the 90s, my college roommate got an invitation for some MLM bullshit and decided to fuck with them.  It was a phone conference call thing for prospective marks, or something.  So, he calls in with his phone (landline) and leaves it on mute.    Guy starts asking who joined and gets no response from us.  He tries several times to find out who it is, but we're on mute.  10 minutes go by and it's just random background sounds.

Finally, we call in on my phone and start acting like were interested.  Immediately, there's 5 people on the call and they're asking questions and sounding real excited for this opportunity.  Where the fuck were they for that 10 minutes?

Anyway, we're on there for about an hour and the others were asking about what it takes to get started and the guy throws out the startup requirements and how much it'll cost and EvErYoNe can't believe how reasonable it sounds.  So the guy asks my friend if he's interested and he says ""Oh, of course.  This sounds like an excellent opportunity and I've got a good idea of what I'm gonna do.""  The guy asks about the financial aspect and my buddy says, ""Sounds reasonable, but I'll have to run it by my cows.""  The guy's like, ""what?""  ""My cows.  They make all the major purchasing decisions.""  ""Your cows?""  ""Yes.  So let me check with them, and I'll get back with you.""  And he confirms his contract information from the invite and disconnects.

Mind you, we still have a 2nd open line with them.  As soon as he hangs up, they start asking if we said 'cows'.  ""Yeah, he said he was gonna check with his cows.""  ""God Damn it, we wasted all this time for a fucking prank.  Well, thanks anyways, guys.  You did good.  I've got some other replies for later this week.  I'll let you know when I'll need you back on...""

Knowing they were about to end their session, my buddy unless the line and let's out this real obnoxious ""MOOOOOOOO!"" and puts it back on mute.

Just last week I made a chill quickplay group and played about three games with a group of dudes. Conversation was like pulling teeth. 

""How we all doing?""

""How's everyone's day going?""

""So where you guys from?""

One word answers or just no answer at all. Every now and then I'd make a crack about how they needed to ""cut the jibber jabber and focus on the game!"" One guy occasionally chuckled. He was immediately my favourite.

Then one guy leaves and I queue to replace him. A lady takes his place, greets us all warmly and asks how we're doing. Finally. Some fucking conversation. 

Suddenly, everyone finds their voice! There are now at least three dudes racing to talk over one another with a bright, cheery ""hello!"", ""Hey, how you doing?"" and even a ""where are you from?""

I immediately call them all out on it: Three games of silence for them to only now find their personalities when someone without a Y chromosome joins. Our newest arrival tells them if that's the case then they all may as well go back to being silent again because she doesn't play overwatch to meet guys.

They all immediately left. Eventually the three of us (occasionally chuckles guy stayed) found some people who had something to say and had a decent night.

It was pretty wild though, seeing the change immediately come over these three sadsacks. Video games are a weird place, man.",positive

12624,">The amount of times guys feel like they need to make sure that I know they're cool with me going about my business was bizarrely high.

Guys in engineering are also used to certain assumptions made about them, especially in relation to their interactions with women/girls. I've personally heard female classmates badmouth some dude about an interaction that I witnessed as well and didn't see any issues with. Stuff like ""he thinks that just because I'm a girl...... etc"", when I've literally had the exact same argument with that guy because he is just stubborn (as are most engineers in my experience). It's not uncommon in engineering classes for the women/ girls to have a chip on their shoulders, but they are just as likely to be useless as their male classmates. 

I guess what I'm saying is it sometimes like there are 2 options for some guys regarding how others view them: either they don't go out of their way to cater to her and they get labeled as misogynist, or they do and maybe get viewed as an ally. So maybe give them a chance? We are notoriously bad at social interaction and maybe they will calm down once they realize you don't think they have a problem with you.

It was doubly entertaining because the BME program was probably the hardest degree to get there. Something like 75% of people would bail to another field after the first year, so the ones that stayed (male or female) were some of the best students.

12739,"I've been gaming online for about 20 years.

I've had this screen name for a little over 10. People usually assume I'm a girl.

The amount of harassment I get is about equal to the harassment I get from people who assume I'm a guy. The amount of *perks* I get from those who assume I'm a girl are infinitely more than from those who assume I'm a guy.

The only real difference, in my case, is the *type* of harassment. There's the typical stuff all around, and then there's some sexist crap thrown in the mix when they think I'm a girl. But again, the overall *amount* of harassment is the same and stings the same (that is, it makes me laugh at their stupidity/anger)

So in my experience over the last 10 years, I actually prefer if the people think I'm a girl. Sometimes I can milk them for free stuff or have them literally act as meat shields.. hilarious. 

That said, I've also been witness to some ex-girlfriends experiences. One gal, a complete badass at every game she plays, never really got harassed. Maybe about the same amount that I do (and really it's not much in my case either)

Another one, who was pretty terrible at every game, got harassed *all the fucking time*. I had to step in to tell people to back off more times than I can count. We played MMOs together and I'd have to threaten to leave the group if they didn't quit their shit (I was either our top DPS or our main healer, depending on the time, so of course they'd listen). When it came to stuff like League of Legends, it was just rough.. we usually just blocked the person and reported them after. I'd usually pair up with her to help improve her score above theirs as well, just to rub dirt into their salty wounds.

So, I guess what I'm saying is.. if your skill level is ""average"" or ""below average"", and you're a girl, your experience will be worse than if you're a guy. But if you're ""above average"", then it's actually a better experience (because you get benefits where the guys don't) *as long as you have mildly thick skin*. (On account of the comments you receive being more sexual in nature). But also, the better you are at a game, the less negativity you experience regardless of sex.

Based on my 10+ years of experience, with this name, of course.

**TLDR** I've been on both sides of the fence due to my user name. I've also witnessed the comments received by ex girlfriends of various skill levels. And the *ultimate deciding factor* is how good you are at a game. If you're bad, you see more toxicity than if you're good. 

Also, if you're a girl and you're not ""above average"" skill, you have a worse time than if you're a boy. However, if you're ""above average"" skill, then it's actually *more enjoyable to be a girl* on account of getting about the same amount of negativity, as well as a bunch of free shit from thirsty boys (if the game has that function)

...so, I guess.. gitgud? (I'm joking, the toxicity is a real problem - but, until things change, this *is* the best way to improve your gaming experience)",positive

Games like Sandstorm and Rising Storm 2 have proximity voice chat, so when 8 guys are trying to cap the same little house 4 on one team 4 on the other, they get to shout things at each other, and it's hilarious.

One time me and my buddy were like ""Okay you take left door Ill take right"" and he said ""Oh yeah right on eh bud?"" and we heard a guy from inside the house go ""HOLY SHIT GUYS GET IN HERE AND HELP ME, THERE'S FUCKING CANADIANS COMING!""

If it's a bad group you eventually switch groups or stop playing, but you already have a bad taste in your mouth for the game due to the group.

I was always that shy guy until I found a great group in an mmorpg who I got along with and made me want to join group chat and shoot the shit with people.

also its fucking hilarious when people act like this, i cannot believe its not like an act or something, maybe it's a weird anecdote or some shit but im not kidding when i say like 40-50% of the players i end up meeting and getting along with, and add them as friends type deal tend to be women (usually i have no idea till we're in a discord call or somethin in the case of games like wow/league), and i play games like Dota, league, overwatch, starcraft, etc. im calling bullshit on even 20-25% of the players being women, its probably higher if you account for people who feel the need to hide that about themselves. i know i firmly fit into that latter category

i truely believe the amount of women playing even competitive ""manly"" video games is FAR higher than most commonly toted figures, and that the perception of it being smaller, the ostricization causing people to be quiet and let people assume they're men etc. creates the illusion of a smaller number.

She goes to a library to use a computer. (Nobody cares and it's mostly silent or what talking does occur is isolated to others staying to themselves.)

It depends on the game too, but overall prepare to have some talks with her about how to handle bad behavior (mute button, leaving a bad lobby, putting the game down if it becomes too upsetting) and not take an anonymous strangers words over the internet too personally...

Hate to break it to you the internet is over 35 years old. The most popular FPS and MMORPG games are played by people who were 14-20 year olds in 2000.  The people you encounter aren't ""hot young professionals"" and if you think the likelyhood of a ""hot young female"" in your pug or in your team is real - you watch too much pretend porn.

Literally, the beating heart of the RP community (esp the ERP community) is lonely women over 35 with train wrecks of a life ongoing and the ERPing with a 18 year old male bothers them not nor does lying about their A/S/L.

You all watch just too much porn.  Streamers who use their bodies to make money and are good at games are professionals and professional actors.  Your fantasy person in reality is the same as the male version - a +40 person, no job, lives in basement, missing a leg due to diabetes, has six kids,  lives on Monster and Froot Loops, and has NO problem pretending to be Candy, the barely 18  year old who could use some money to pay for college.",negative

It‚Äôs definitely helped me be mindful of my own behavior and that of others among colleagues. 

A wine and paint night at a local art gallery with my girlfriend also comes to mind. She really wanted me to go with her, her sister, and a mutual friend.

I ended up excusing myself to the bar halfway through because I couldn‚Äôt stand it.

I don‚Äôt speak for everyone of course and I‚Äôm sure some people like that kind of attention regardless of gender. But I remember comments from female friends and relatives and realize that the discomfort I felt in these and a couple other rare situations is what many women have to deal with *all the time.* We need to be respectful of others and recognize how our actions might be perceived as well as being comfortable providing clear communication when certain behaviors make us uncomfortable.",positive

You screw up once and as long as you spoke on mic as a woman it's your fault.

Have so much recorded footage of guys either being pigs about me or just out right mean. It's why I stopped playing after awhile. Someone can only handle so much.

And sure I could have just not spoken on mic, but I'm a raiding girl at heart in WoW and FFXIV...so communication is key to win. End game content/ranked is all based around teamwork so if you have one guy giving someone a hard time, you're pretty much down two players depending if the person harassed reacts.

13581,"Yeah my girlfriend used to play overwatch and it was pretty shit. She still made it to diamond because that game doesnt really need mic for soloqueue so she still climbed alone. 
Now she plays valorant and it is a huge issue to have to talk in-game, not because or the guys hitting on her like morons, but because of the guys that get incredibly hostile as soon as they hear her. They immediately start to imply she is bad and they need to carry her and since that usually doesnt happen they start throwing tantrums to make her fail, like using utility to block her vision, calling out her position on all chat when she needs to clutch, or mic spamming sexist bullshit and insults until she has to mute them, at which point she has to cut herself to the team's callouts due to one or two assholes.

This has happened multiple times, the reaction women get in a game really depends on culture and game. Overwatch was the most toxic game I have experienced as a guy. Much more toxic than league even though I played mid high elo in overwatch but never got above gold in league. But for her, overwatch was not nearly as toxic as vslorant. She more often than not got hit on rather than flamed, though that did of course also happen since she mostly carried with tanks and some people believe that she was only allowed to play supports. But valorant is just disgusting for her, so she cant really duo queue and climb the ranks alone and instead plays ranked with friends that are not really at her skill level.
Still, at least she gets to have fun that way.",negative

It was a simple rule I would either let us win or lose depending how they behave, at the time I was playing competitively at LAN events and online tournaments and I had to use a smurf due to me and her rank difference.

My GF is actually very good at the game considering she's never played PC games or shooting games before, about Gold Nova level.  She looks pretty clueless in what she's doing in game and her spray control is non-existent.  However she has good reflexes and her aim is probably better than most DMGs let alone gold nova (just the other stuff that lets her down)

She would get A LOT of abuse due to people spectating her and seeing her be confused on what do to in any given situation (like these other fools in Gold Nova actually know any better...), in which case since I had the ability to win Gold Nova level games by myself I would either win the game or throw it, depending on how big an arsehole my team is being towards her.

13699,"""gaming communities"" aren't all just one big community though so that's a difficult thing to say.  

Take any match based game like any shooter or rocket league or Among Us or whatever. Everyone are strangers unless you're playing with friends.  

So it's not really about ""other males don't call out their bad behaviour"" because ""males"" is an extremely diverse group of people whose single and only commonality is their sex.  

In one game you may have a lot of issues because it's full of similar immature dumbarses, and in others you may get no problems. The normal people from game B can't exactly tell the dipshit weirdo in game A to stop being creepy.  

In-game voice chats are basically always toxic as fuck as a general rule, it's why I just play with friends only. No way in hell would I join a public game with a bunch of randoms and have in game voice on. It's just not fun.  

Now if we start to talk about actual communities then you see way less problems because no one likes shit in their own home.  

If a person is lacking friends who play games, then either finding a discord community, or playing a game which is community focused, like WoW or even Destiny where you actually have guilds you join. And so long as they've got real people in them and aren't just a group of kids, there's going to be very few issues.  

In the better part of a decade or more all actual communities/groups I've been in have all had girls, no one is weird because the weird people end up getting the boot pretty quickly if they don't stop being weird.  

Once you already have a group of people that know each other, no one stands for some random person joining who starts being sexist or creepy. They're going to get flicked instantly.  

But if you're in random matches with random people, I'm sorry but you simply can't stop it. If you're in the lobby with 90 other people before a PUBG match there's no one that can call something out, because everyone is just being stupid. If a person doesn't like that then you've just gotta turn off voice chat.   

Places like that you cannot control, it's wild west. If you want a nice place then you need a group of friends or a guild or group you can join to just chill and play games with. And then you're not gonna get any issues.  

So I wholly agree it'd be nice if we could just make all these people no be creeps, but you can't control other people, all you can do is control yourself and who you hang around. And that's where friends and good guilds / groups come in.",positive

I've been doing online gaming for.. 20 years? It's been mostly positive/neutral.

I've found that when you're constantly undeniably the reason your team is winning, people don't really flame you. (They still will, because their egos get hurt, but far less often) It also helps if you're friendly/supportive in a ""Hey shit happens, don't worry about it"" way when people make mistakes.

If you really want a nice experience, play something that isn't a competition. If there's a winning team, there's going to be sore losers and aggressive elitists. If you're playing something like an MMORPG, then there're assholes that you can weed out (blacklist) and eventually you find yourself among only the groups of nice players - who are usually better at the game as well.",positive

At one point they asked which support was which. I said I was Zenyatta, the girl was Mercy. (She was pretty good at Mercy too, her stats were way better than my usual Mercy matches.) The older guy starts complaining about how girls always go for Mercy cuz they never know how to really play. Then everyone on the team starts mocking her, saying she needs to play a real character, a few say she should just quit, etc.

I felt bad so I told them all to shut up, let her play, and to just play the game. They all start screaming that I'm just doing it cuz I like her, or that she's my girlfriend or something. She goes really quiet and leaves a few minutes later. I quit after that.

>And honestly men like you drive the women away or force them to not use mics

There it is again, that gaslighting bully fallacy. Women are not driven away from gaming, but they do come into gaming with a lot of pre-existing prejudices. You are just using whatever excuses you can find to justify your own misandry, toxic behaviour and attacks. Vilifying men you resent for existing is a very easy way to do this.

The fact is, most women do not like gaming and men who game(typically a hobby that is viewed as unmasculine, uncool or counter-productive to men's traditional gender roles of provider/protector). Your own negative attitude towards male gamers is driving you away from using mics in games. Not men. The excuses you come up with after the fact don't really match the reality of the situation. 

>That's half the reason it's such a boy's club in the first place, you scare more femme noobs away with your toxic bs.

Right, because I am addressing your prejudices, which are pre-existing, I am being toxic. And, no, women are not being scared off by men who are, in all reality, incredibly supportive and welcoming to women. You are literally attacking men right now for being attracted to female gamers and trying to engage them.

 Most women are already taught to have a negative attitude towards gaming, and men in gaming, before they even pick up a controller. This is why men are usually excited or surprised when they meet women who aren't, and why women look for every reason not game(and then blame the men they are already taught to hate for it). I could easily make the case that hateful, petty, entitled and misandric women are far more to blame for women having these prejudices or ""driving new women away"".",negative

Maybe if someone never meets women, it‚Äôs because the women have chosen to fly under the radar and they should examine why.

Avoiding stereotyping people by their appearance is something we should work hard at but as you say, it is human nature. Don't feel too bad about it. Pattern recognition and putting labels on people is something we do subconsciously, I applaud you for realizing it's a problem and putting effort into being better. We all have many facets to our personality, and almost all people are more than they seem.

More people also need to realize the impact the way they present themselves has on the way they're perceived. It makes a *massive* difference.

It's extremely common to find women who will ridicule men for not being sufficiently masculine, who actually seek after aggressive/violent men who will ""fight for them"", and so forth.",negative
14687,"Seriously? That's no way near a first.

Women may be largely anti-toxic masculinity now, at least outwardly, but you have to understand that people's behavior is largely driven by the desire to mate. Men behave badly because over time it is what has proven to work.

So, maybe women aren't very vocal in participating in toxic masculinity... but they create and perpetuate it every time they choose the bully over the nerdy guy, or break up with a guy for being too emotional, or even refuse to date someone because he is too fat. And trust me when I say plenty of women still do it.

Overall, toxic masculinity would not exist if it wasn't an effective strategy for finding a mate. 

Not to say men aren't guilty, we are plenty guilty. We unfortunately don't break up with women who expect this. We don't allow ourselves the safety to be weak among friends. And we keep buying into our own bullshit, defending bad behaviors brcause we're actually all a little afraid of what will happen if we just let go. 

And that results in the few really bad guys popping up, who make women actually give a damn about toxic masculinity.

I was playing a co-op defense and one dude absolutely flipped his shit and ragequit because I didn't have a penis. A few of the other people in chat were like ""wow. Ignore him. And also, haha, let's all see if we can cover his empty area."" If it had been silence, I probably would have quit too. But even with that, I learned how ""dangerous"" it was to appear in any way as feminine. Masking the pronouns you use to refer to friends or SOs. Curbing your stories. Making yourself small so that the thing you like to do doesn't end up ruined over something outside of your control.

It took me a long time to be okay openly admitting online that I'm a woman and not a man. Things are different now than they were, but it's still plenty toxic in certain places.",positive

If someone shares the same interests as you, seems like a reasonable person, and is single, why wouldn't you try and at least try to pursue something more if that's what you want? If they turn you down, thems the breaks, but there's literally zero downside to at least attempting it, especially in a hobby where most people are introverted as fuck and there's a massive perceived gender imbalance, so that's your only real source of social interaction.

I've never personally asked someone out over online stuff, but I understand it completely. Pretty much my entire standards in a partner are ""Do they play video games or watch anime? If one or both of these is fulfilled they are in consideration for a date, if not, we probably will not have enough in common for anything to work out.""

On the flip side, I also get why women might want to hide that they're women, specifically because of that gender imbalance.

People aren't born with an inherent knowledge of does and don't when pursing romantic partners or social interactions in general. Media's idea of romance isn't great either, even when it claims to be a ""guide"" and not outright hollywood fiction. People learn this stuff through experience, rejection and time, and if we are honest, no one ever truly ""figures it out"" before they lock down a consistent partner through luck, and the people who claim to are the sort of ""dating guru"" creeps that shouldn't be encouraged.  


Hell, give the kids credit for pursing someone based purely on a shared interests regardless of appearance at the very least.  


Sure, we can teach kids to never ask anyone out or make any sort of advances, but every hormonal adolescent thinks they are the exception to the rule; ""this is the 1 in 100 scenario where if I just put myself out there it could happen.""

Of course, shouldn't be tolerated from adults, but those are the exception. Competitive online gaming trends young and male, reject their advances so they can mature, or pretend to me a guy.

14889,"yeah this is a very well-known phenomenon.  computers themselves used to be ""women's work"" but the *second* it became lucrative suddenly it was a masculine thing - earliest programmers were women.  same in any industry, a lot were originally established by women and then as they become lucrative it then becomes male dominated and women start being questioned about their competency.

a lot of it has to do with sex roles established in the 20th century with men as ""breadwinners"" earning extremely large incomes that'd make millenials and zoomers heads spin, enough to support a family with a subservient and purely domestic unemployed wife.  so any job that started paying well was just automatically made masculine.

this ties into modern incel movements, as now wages have fallen far, far below what boomers earned but the sex roles remain.  for those in relationships, both parties have to work to survive, which emasculates men who feel like it's impossible for them to live up these outdated masculine standards and of course drains women who both have to work *and* are expected to do all the ""women's work"" of a relationship in order to soothe the ego of their partner.  so we get a lot of reactionary young dudes, many of whom are single and feel they can't actually date unless they earn a lot of money (and very few people can nowadays), angry as shit at women for ""taking away"" the life promised to them by the 50's in the US and further and further alienated.  you get incels, the alt-right, and of course the call of duty playerbase.

That's three sets of experience. Not a huge sample size. And my years are but a blink in the grand scheme of things. If I were to include the experiences I've witnessed from other friends, many of whom are women, it doesn't change anything.

Those who were good at the games experienced far less trash talk than those who were bad at them (among men and women). The trash talk for the women was more sexual in nature than it was for the men (unless you count their moms). The weird stalker-like behavior is *almost exclusively* experienced by women (including myself when perceived as a woman), but is thankfully easy to handle since most online games have a blacklist feature.

Back then, you‚Äôd find a cool server every once in a while and become a regular, coming back occasionally to play TTT games on weekends or something and you‚Äôd get to know the other regulars. We had our fair share of female and males. It mainly worked out because we were part of the same community and our main goal was to relax by doing stupid shit in games and having fun. Whenever one of those types of misogynistic guys came around, the regulars (and mods) wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to tell them to fuck off.

Then I'm constantly wishing it could just be a good experience so they would Ever want to come back to the game and feeling like it's my fault for wanting to play it and the community is a cesspool.

14904,"Here are some common ones.

- Lack of female characters. Important characters and playable characters are all or almost all male. While having some games with male protagonists is obviously normal, having the vast majority be male can start to make people feel unwanted. 

- Fewer options for female characters. An example is the ~~Stardew Valley~~ (Edit: Wrong title, meant Harvest Moon) game where male characters could continue playing after having an in-game baby, but female characters could not.

- Female characters dressed in much more revealing or sexualized outfits than male characters. It's not fun to feel like a game considers you nothing more than eye candy or sex sells.

- Female characters having weaker abilities or support only abilities when compared to male characters. That's things like making the female characters stealth while the male characters can fight, or having the female characters have primarily healer or support abilities. Again, not a problem if it happens sometimes, but definitely a problem when it's happening constantly. 

- Consistently presenting female characters as things to be escorted, saved, or won. 

- The villains getting immediately rapey when threatening female characters, but not when threatening male characters.

The game never starts up by saying ""And there are NO GIRLS allowed in our clubhouse!"" It's little things here and there that make you realize that a game doesn't want you, or doesn't expect you to be playing. That the game maybe considers you nothing more than a sex object, or on the less extreme side simply considers you less important than male players.",positive

Similarly we should try to counteract predatory behavior by men.

They tend to keep it down a bit more on global chats and want to harass you more privately, but I will say it happened to me a lot.

Even had one guy on a game pm me my address...

So, I'm just one woman and if it has happened to me more times than can be reasonably kept track of to count (because there is no use keeping track of something that always happens) then you can bet it happens way more than what you can count.

Even if it isn't always an unwanted message, on voice chats when I get on there are always comments like ""oh, its a girl. Guess we should clean up our talk."" and they never really fail to ask my age and where I live, or some other comments making a much bigger deal out of my appearance on a game than I would get if I were a guy.",positive

Also, not every game uses discord. Line is also a big one (especially with games which are more popular in asia) and very different where anyone can message you unless you block them.

Some games with guilds require the guild members to have to have another form of talking to coordinate certain events that take planning and teamwork.

I also am the raid leader in both a WoW raid group and a FFXIV one. I parse better numbers then them all as a DPS, Tank AND I'm obnoxiously amazing on heals(because that's what I used to do).

15489,"Yeah... Now that I think about it. Usually most boys are emotionally educated to _supress_ their emotions. Dont cry, act tough, remain calm, dont have emotional outburts, dont act lewd. Society usually teaches them to not show too many emotions, whether it be because male emotional outburts tend to be more destructive (they are stronger afterall), or because their role is to be pillars and breadwinners at the house. Of course, nowadays this is changing, but this has been the norm for most of human history. You dont change that in less than a century. Many parents still educate their children this way, and children themselves feel an implied need to act this way just by watching other adult men. 

So... when you constantly tell someone to supress their emotions their whole lives, and then suddenly give them an outlet which is completely anonymous, and allows them to be as emotional as they want, what do you get? Horny, emotionally unstable, and quick to anger gamers. All the piled up emotions just spill out with the tiniest trigger. 

This comment has really helped me reflect on many people's behaviour in the internet in general, not just videogames. I myself tend to be much more agressive and emotional in the  internet, especially during periods when Im depressed alone, which happens to be most of my life. Thankfully I can still almost always supress my negative emotions when voice chatting with friends/strangers, but I find myself going off the rails a lot in comment sections when something impacts me emotionally, and it seems to happen a lot to others too.

15614,"Well, it's that way for life in general, isn't it?

If people respect you, they'll treat you better. And then there will be a few people who you either need to work harder to earn their respect, or who will never give you respect because they're just toxic by nature (mean to those they see as below them, and jealous of those above them.. so mean to them as well. ""Haters"")

In a game you earn respect in two ways: Your attitude and your ability to play the game. One of these is more important than the other, but both help.

Unfortunately, women get less respect out of the gate from a large number of people. There are many reasons for this and I don't personally agree with any of them. But, again, respect can be earned (and lost) within the gaming communities based on attitude and skill. 

With many games, like CoD and LoL, the games are short enough and player base large enough, that you usually only have the course of that one game to earn respect.. and then you'll rarely see those players again, unless you're on the very top or the very bottom. (Thanks matchmaking) Once you're up top, the toxicity tends to fade away, because everybody gets to know the others and can acknowledge their skill.. at that point respect difference is almost directly related to attitude. 

If you're on the bottom.. well holy shit, I've seen some things on the bottom. Literal cesspools. (My ex was hard stuck Bronze V in LoL.. what a nightmare). She received negative comments every game and it was a generally terrible experience for her. So, I jumped on her account and played 46 games (43-3 record.. I remember being proud about that for some reason) in order to drag her back up to silver. In my time playing her account, I received negative comments at the start of almost every game, and praise and excitement later in the game and in future lobbies from those same players.. because I was single-handedly carrying them.

For the record: She used a typically male-assumed name (Ichigo), while I used this name (often assumed female). The toxicity directed at her was worse and more frequent than at me *by a long shot*. She responded poorly to it, often raging in chat - something I typically don't do. This caused her to play worse, get flamed more, and it's really just a downward spiral at that point.

All this said: Skill is the primary factor toward respect levels. Attitude is the secondary factor. And sex is probably the tertiary factor (though ability to spell/type well could possibly be above that, if we're honest)

..very similar to life. If you're successful, people give you more respect. If you've got a good attitude, same thing but nowhere near as impactful. And if you're a woman or person of color (games usually don't have an indicator for this one), then you start at a lower base value. *And there will always be haters*",positive
15615,"I think I understand what you're saying, and I could have explained better. I do agree that you have to be ready for the toxic environment, I've seen that  more than once and may have unintentionally contributed to one, so I may not be faultless, but hear me out.  

I don't know your experience. My experience has been that there are games/lobbies where there is rampant toxicity, and others where there is acceptance and encouragement. I see more acceptance than not, and I hope the same for you. 

I will still encourage you to be positive, because positive people will respect what you are doing and they will either seek you out in games or add you to a safelist. It may take some time, but it will happen. When I say you get what you give, I mean that when you are a positive player or online commenter, you will eventually start hearing more from others who are positive as well. There may always be people who will antagonize you for awhile, but they will go away.  

Either way, best of luck to you, may all your future games be filled with awesome people.",positive

The only one I‚Äôd have an argument against is the example of female characters needing to be saved/escorted/won. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs way more common for female characters but plenty of male characters are also presented in the same way. Not exactly the same because with women it‚Äôs always portrayed as a damsel in distress type of situation.

Either way, things need to change among the gaming industry but sadly that won‚Äôt happen without voices within the companies speaking out about the issues. Which is whole other issue because women don‚Äôt always feel safe speaking out at work. Especially in male dominated environments.

Hopefully we see some change overtime. In the meantime all I can say is I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with being overly sexualized and demeaned. Especially since all you want a game to do is provide stress relief, not piss you off.",neutral
15619,"> Lack of female characters. Important characters and playable characters are all or almost all male... 

Mojority of games have character customisation aka both genders 

>Fewer options for female characters. An example is the Stardew Valley game where male characters could continue playing after having an in-game baby, but female characters could not.

this is some kind of cherry picking some weird designe choices from one game. Edit: was it even a thing? I couldnt find anything about it.

>Female characters dressed in much more revealing or sexualized outfits than male characters. It's not fun to feel like a game considers you nothing more than eye candy or sex sells.

its also done to male characters just in different way as they are marketed to female audience which means egy bois, daddys, guys with 24packs on their stomach etc you can check the newest creations from league of legends or genshin impact 

>Female characters having weaker abilities or support only abilities when compared to male characters. 

nobody does that... it doesnt make sense weaker characters doesnt sell well. Supporting is not female character only thing. Not even talking about how support characters dont need to be weak by any means :V

>Consistently presenting female characters as things to be escorted, saved, or won. 

Again its not female only thing? In most games you escort help and save both male and female about ""wining"" it depends on game for example in dragon age you can ""win"" both female and male

It might be because our society has simultaneously created a culture that encourages men to exert power and demands them to be successful sexually, as well as created a group of men with little to no contact with women in general.

In online games specifically this behaviour has been around for decades and is widely accepted and perpetuated because people will follow the majority. If young men are used to their peers treating women around them badly, they will pick up that attitude. It's like in school when a group of kids will be led by one or two people to be loud and obnoxious, but if you remove the leader they may be perfectly nice.

A lot of us will do as the people around us do. It's peer pressure. If your friends catchall girls on the street, odds are you'd feel pressured to join, because you want to fit in. To be ""one of the boys"". And when this becomes a widespread thing lots of men don't know, or don't think about, the damage they are doing.

16150,"i mean, that depends on what you mean by ""this.""  insofar as oppressive gender roles go, you're correct in that it's ancient, but hte specific dynamic of men being breadwinners while women are housewives doing domestic work is actually relatively new, getting its start in the 19th century alongside industrialization.  the idea that women can't or shouldn't do hard labor would have been utterly laughable in, say, the 18th century where women obviously were doing a lot of farmwork right alongside their husbands.  and even with the industrial revolution, a lot of women did factory jobs.

the breadwinner dynamic could only have existed under a very specific set of circumstances, namely A) capitalism, because the entire concept is predicated on wage labor and not, say, a self-sufficent agrarian community where the whole community is taking care of each other and raising children communally B) very high wages that humanity hasn't really seen before or since that enable one man's income to afford a house and support not only a wife but multiple children, none of whom do wage or farm labor (though the wife would have been working her ass off maintaining that property, a lot of drug abuse happened during this period by middle class white women that just kind of doesn't ever get acknowledged).

the whole two-story house paid outright on one man's labor thing in particular came about over cold war fears of nuclear war.  suburban sprawl was seen as a way to counteract the damage a nuclear strike would do, as dense urban centers were seen as unacceptably vulnerable and would have wiped out too much of the workforce.  so that cheap housing on the outskirts of cities was kind of subsidized, with massive infrastructure projects (in parrticular highways) undertaken to enable a man's morning commute.

a lot of modern bigotries really didn't exist in their current form hundreds of years ago.  hell, in the 1400's *whitteness* didn't exist conceptually, nobody thought of themselves as white or someone else as black.  racism's a relatively recent social construct, predated by sorta similar concepts like ""foreigner"" or ""barbarian"" that missed crucial elements like heredibility (so a child born to a barbarian could be seen as fully Roman, whereas someone born to a black father would be considered black no matter what).  the world really hasn't looked much like american culture for very long, and odds are it'll radically change again.",negative

The result when you switch back to normal voice is hilarious. For a woman, this would be a swap to a voice changer that makes them sound like a man. 

The fact of the matter is that I've been on both sides of the fence. I've ridden them out. I've had a few cases where they believed I was a woman for over a year.

Sometimes we remain friends and other times I get called foul things and/or blocked, and I'm perfectly okay with that. (I mean, it sucks a little? But fuck toxic people who give a shit about what's between your legs ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Also, if they ever start showing awkward attraction-type stuff, I shut that shit down immediately. I'm not about to go making some guy think I'm his girlfriend, *that's going way too far.*)

...anyway. I prefer the side where they think I'm a girl.  Because the negative comments and actions I can just shrug off, no matter how fucked up they are (they're just words) and the perks from ""simps"" are something that men never get.

I suppose it's all about how you look at things.

Oh, and to the down-vote brigade. **You're a bunch of cuties**. I know you don't agree with my opinion, or you think my lived experience is bullshit. That's fine. I know you can't understand why I would possibly prefer to be viewed as a woman while playing games. Try both sides for yourself sometime, you might understand. 

**TIP:** Don't try to sell it too hard, just use a name that could have people making assumptions. Talk like a normal person, because that's what wo/men are - people. When you find a *toxic* fish that's taken the bait, play with them for a while. Lead them on. Then, when the time is right, fuck their day up.",negative
16153,"Huh. Well, everybody has different experiences I suppose.

I've done the female avatar thing my whole life. I know some people think that's weird, but fuck 'em. I don't like looking at a big muscular guy all day. (Except when I was a Tauren, that was fun) And, like I said, I've used this name for over half of my online life as well.

Lots of free shit in MMOs. Most commonly from exchanges like 

""What are you up to?""

""Oh, just gathering ____ so I can level this skill, I'm trying to be able to make ____""

""Oh, here you go."" *Hands me a big-ass stack of materials* (often times including materials I don't even need, but that have some value)

""Uh, wow, thanks! Do you want some money or something for these?""

""Nah, keep it""

16156,"I still think it really depends on the game. For example, I play a lot of League of Legends, and I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that it‚Äôs 80% negative interactions to 20% positive. I think that poorly moderated communities can get to the point where those who aren‚Äôt toxic just refuse to engage at all and mute everyone by default, which results in a largely toxic and unchanging culture. This is certainly something that LoL is known for, but I‚Äôve experienced it in games like Call of Duty and R6 Siege as well. 


I‚Äôm beyond the point where it bother me personally. I mostly play with friends and just mute enemy teams. I try to be friendly, but if it‚Äôs not reciprocated, I‚Äôll just mute people. It‚Äôs a shame that it has to be that way, and I wish there was better moderation.",positive

On escort characters: Yeah, I don't mean to say that every little side escort quest is bad. Like you said, those are often very neutral and it's just as common to be escorting a man as it is to be escorting a woman. I'm talking more about games that give you a vulnerable companion character (vulnerable during gameplay, during cutscenes, or both) that's present through a large portion of the game. These weak characters the story compels you to protect are almost always either women or children. It's pretty rare for a game to give you an adult man that's almost entirely helpless and needs to be protected all game or saved from abduction frequently.",positive
16159,"> Mojority of games have character customisation aka both genders 

A great deal still don't. There are tons of games that have little to no customization.

> Edit: was it even a thing? I couldnt find anything about it.

You got me there, I totally forgot the name of the game. I was thinking Harvest Moon. I apologize for the error and have now corrected it with an edit.

> its also done to male characters just in different way as they are marketed to female audience which means egy bois, daddys, guys with 24packs on their stomach etc you can check the newest creations from league of legends or genshin impact 

It's true that some games are slowly introducing a little of this now. But most sex appeal characters are still female, and it is *incredibly* rare to find a mainstream game where *all* the male characters are meant to be eye candy for straight women. Very easy to find games where all the female characters are there as eye candy. The exception is garbage mobile games, which do sometimes try to appeal exclusively to women.

> nobody does that... it doesnt make sense weaker characters doesnt sell well. Supporting is not female character only thing. Not even talking about how support characters dont need to be weak by any means :V

The weaker characters aren't there to sell the game, they're there to give you something to protect. It is true that support characters aren't by definition ineffective, but most of them do lack the ability to be effective solo. I love support characters, but there's a problem when that's seen as a role for women. 

Think of it like cooking. Cooking is great, useful, and fun. But when you're told that the role of a good wife is to support your husband by cooking for him, that's not so great. It's like that.

For a random example, see the game Ico. Now let me be clear- I love Ico to death. But it does play into this trope. Yorda (female) is physically weaker than Ico and cannot defend herself, relying on Ico to protect her. 

> okey i would like to ask wtf are you playing? Like what? Where? Which game?

16279,"So let's start with the 'deserving' aspect of this conversation. When you state that men feel invisible or don't get adequate attention from women, that inherently means that you think they 'deserve' more attention. 

As for anecdotal evidence, where do you see this being widely reported? Can you point me towards some accredited and/or well researched studies on this topic? Not trying to do the 'gotchya' type thing, I am just trying to educate myself more on this issue I was not aware of. 

Sorry, I was not trying to generalize you. I'm sure you have friends IRL, that was not my intended assertion. Rather, I have just noticed that most people that 'complain' about not getting enough attention from women, normally do so on the internet in forums and communities that are intended for 'lonely' men. 

It's great that you are listening to others, that's a great way to find information, but again, you are essentially describing anecdotal evidence. Which as you can see, has led you to overgeneralized assumptions. 

Your last few questions are interesting and I'll answer them the best I can. Some women have shown a strong interest, (not as often, Ill give ya that lol), but most if not all, showed their attention and affection while in a relationship. I think that points more towards my decision-making, meaning I generally will not try and pursue a relationship with someone who is not giving me attention. That, I think, is where these 'lonely, attention-starved' men you speak of get it wrong. Not getting attention from someone purely because of their gender is ridiculous.

If you try and plow through everything right away with a completionist mindset you end up having to grind quite a bit.  

Likewise, the interface is very simplistic, which makes the game cute and intuitive. But the simple interface can make complex tasks somewhat tedious.  For example catching and selling a fish gets you some charming dialogue and involves a few menus.  Easy enough. But if you try to farm hundreds of fish you get sucked into tons of tedious inventory management and menu navigation. You're encouraged to be chill and casual rather than tryharding.

I recommend at least checking one of the games out at some point.  AC is definitely not the kind of game I usually play, but for some reason the chill creativity ended up hooking me.  Though the social element is a major draw, so it helps if you have friends playing it too.",positive

ye but my point is that there is shit load of female protagonist in games so its not like they are not represented 

>It's true that some games are slowly introducing a little of this now. But most sex appeal characters are still female, and it is incredibly rare to find a mainstream game where all the male characters are meant to be eye candy for straight women. Very easy to find games where all the female characters are there as eye candy. The exception is garbage mobile games, which do sometimes try to appeal exclusively to women.

changes in trends suggest that market is starting to be more and more open to female gamers tho

>The weaker characters aren't there to sell the game, they're there to give you something to protect.

i mean ye but genarally speaking games put both genders in that scenario (i guess we are talking here about NPCs in single player games)

>ye, but most of them do lack the ability to be effective solo.

tbh in many games they can stand their ground solo unless we are talking about only healing supports. 

>I love support characters, but there's a problem when that's seen as a role for women...

true the idea that supporting is for women is shity 

I was talking about characters because its absolutely not like games make female characters to be only weak supports many games goes with strong female characters - league of legends, dota 2, Dragon age etc

>For a random example, see the game Ico. Now let me be clear- I love Ico to death. But it does play into this trope. Yorda (female) is physically weaker than Ico and cannot defend herself, relying on Ico to protect her. 

i mean it does happen but its not like its some kind of standard for games to do it

>But it does show up in games from time to time, where you'll sometimes see villains that will make sexual threats towards women but never towards men.

It's not your job to stop it. Be a good person and surround yourself with other good people. Don't waste your time or energy on trolls and disrespectful people. Just move on.

I got 2 comments, ‚ÄúOk Boomer‚Äù and the girl who‚Äôs good at many games and talked about her experience, which offered a viewpoint I did not consider. That is, ignoring the general skill of people that brought up, plenty of people getting mad at girls for playing at all *because they exist and they‚Äôre in the game with them*, not necessarily because ‚Äúgirls are bad at games‚Äù. 

We both agree that girls *feel like they should play a certain way* to essentially keep the peace and lie low, hers being some girls would rather not bother anyone and just play support. Come to think of it, most of the time I‚Äôve played with girls, they‚Äôre usually playing with a boyfriend, so it would make sense that they play support because they‚Äôre generally not familiar with or good at the game. That‚Äôs different than a girl playing the game because they want to or playing a game they usually do, which puts them in the same bracket as guys.

Because I think the real problem is that for hundreds of years a man could easily buy a wife without having to be nice and could go off and cheat without consequences because a woman was considered property and had no options.

Men are now facing consequences for cheating, and they have to actually win the affection or a woman and keep it or she'll leave him, which means that he needs to step up and act like an adult and not a toddler in order to have a partner.

(Maybe slightly different, but still the same - like most of my friends who are women don't worry that their man will leave them because they lose their job, but they DO worry that their man will leave them because they lose their good looks, which can be equally as random and unpredictable or health-related. At the end of the day though, the base of these worries is the same, ""What if something changes and my partner leaves me? How will I know if my future spouse will stay with me through struggles?"" 

There's no guarantee for anyone. Which sucks, but it also means that most people who want a genuine relationship are stressed about the same things, and hope to work towards the same sort of faithful stability. So you're definitely not alone in your feelings. Idk, this has become a wall of text now, but I just hope you know you're not alone feeling that way and hope this helps you feel better somehow. 

Of course, I also just wish there weren't so many shitty people out there that we all have to be so concerned about stuff like that :(",positive

Funnily enough I have been gaming since I was three ish. But I have a brother who is 7 years older than me... So naturally I was always the assist character and if he had friends over or wanted to play a solo game I didn't get to play at all (a lot of the time). 

It was nintendo, sega, and ps1 with my older brother. They often got broken. I remember one time he straight up threw the sega out the window. 

Then when he moved out we had a ps1 and 2 and I played a fair bit on that. Mostly Ratchet and Clank, Crash Bandicoot, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, and Evil Twin up until a level I always got stuck at. I've been EVERYWHERE on the level and interacted with everything but still couldn't progress. Still salty. Part of me suspects that the game was faulty somehow.

As I got older I mostly did all the challenges and hard bits for my younger siblings. So now that's what I'm good at. 

I hate shooter games. I can't aim for shit as the games I've played above don't really train that ability.

Stop throwing around the word ""harassment"" because it just serves to make light of people who are subject to actual harassment, not people who surround themselves with kids then complain how kids don't act more adult.

I honestly don't know how young girls who are attracted to women act towards women in games . . . do you? I can only speak to social and cultural expectations put on boys to ""take the initiative"" and to ""put themselves out there, take risks"" ""don't be inexperienced, get practice"" where pursing romantic partners are concern.

So, I am sorry if you feel hard done by for having to reject advances of young boys who have yet to learn of the social faux pas of a very specific culturally norm while they are on a global platform, but if you piss in the wind, you are going to get wet. You can yell and scream at the wind for being wind as much as you want, it isn't going to change anything.

What exactly is your idea of a solution to this problem if not one of the ones I presented (that you interesting chose to dodge)? It's not ""teach young boys to never ask out women under any circumstances"" because, like I've said repeatedly now and you've continued to ignore, it's a learned experience. They've got to see their actions result in a rejection to believe that it won't work, because we've all been raised on hollywood romance ideals where there's a 1 in 1000 chance that you'll meet the perfect partner doing something you mutual love to do and all it takes is for you to take the risk as ask . . . because that's what you are essentially demonising here . . . asking someone out.

Imagine being so jaded that when a kid works up the courage to express a romantic interest in someone, for the first time as far as we know, based not on physical appearance, but on a shared interest and personality, that your first instinct is to call foul and act like you're the victim of some malicious conspiracy to make you feel bad . . . you know, instead of the reality of a prepubescent kid, driven by a cocktail of hormones, asking an innocuous question.

Which is exactly why such wristbands are a terrible business idea, because by supplying a preemptive refusal that actually turns all of those failed approaches into harassment.

Second, presumably as the only bar providing such a service, most of the female patrons would want those wristbands. So, no, there is no way that every guy competing for the 2 girls in the entire place not wearing wristbands is a better system for the guys... Except insomuch as it let's them avoid the establishment entirely. 

And finally, judging by the fact that every developed nation eventually falls below replacement level birthrates, there's a pretty good case to be made that men constantly approaching women and many other traditional, patriarchal beliefs and practices around sexuality are necessary for the survival of the species. Because the more those practices and beliefs are rejected, the lower the birthrates seem to go. 

So in all seriousness, I really think that you should consider if it's better that women have to constantly do the work of rejecting men for the small percentage chance that a man they won't reject will approach them, or whether it's better that we take another step closer to there eventually being no women (or men too approach them) at all, because humans have gone extinct. Because as far as I know, no modern nation that has fallen below replacement level birthrates has managed to reverse the trend. And several have been trying for years, if not decades. So it is completely reasonable to be concerned that every nation will eventually find itself in that situation, and that humanity will find itself in permanent decline once that happens.

There is a very real question of how much inconvenience individuals should expected to bear in the interest of humanity as a whole. And I'm quite sure that you've never actually considered that question, because very few ordinary citizens are actually looking at the impending demographic disaster that decades of low birth rates have left hanging over every developed nation.

I mean, I used to argue against traditional religious views around sex and sexuality because I thought that they were just a way to maximize the number of people breeding, which was no longer necessary. But turns out that, no, unless society strongly enforces the need for people to make babies, people don't make enough babies... And that's even with the fact that modern medicine means that ""enough babies"" is a lot less babies per adult than it used to be.

And again, because of the fact that no nation has managed to reverse the trend, this is actually a legitimate existential risk to humanity that needs to be discussed. People who aren't paying attention don't realize it yet, but low-birth rates is on track to be the next ""climate change"" level challenge for humanity.",neutral

Young boys playing video games are treated as normal, while young girls who show an interest are often discouraged. 

Here's an interesting bit of information: the primary reason men dominate the field of software development is because in the 80s, when personal computers were just becoming a thing, [they were marketed towards boys](https://qz.com/911737/silicon-valleys-gender-gap-is-the-result-of-computer-game-marketing-20-years-ago/). 

Even *to this day* I see it all the time. Young women who show an interested in computing, video games, or any other traditionally ""male"" hobby are often turned away from it, if not by adults than by their own peers. No one likes being told they're weird or stupid or abnormal for liking something, and young people especially will give up on those hobbies instead of pursuing them and tolerating the ridicule.

Computers, cars, maths, stem in general. They tried this same bs with toys children play with too. As if toy companies decides biology, males as young as toddlers already show interest in mechanical stuff and Lego, girls play with dolls.

Same with female protagonists. I like well written female protagonists. On some level I can connect with them more. But that doesn't mean I hated Witcher because it forced my to play as Geralt. He's a predefined character in a medieval era type world, making him a her would have fundamentally changed the story and fucked with the lore. I actually have a much bigger issue with games that just squish female protagonists in for ""equality"". Like I hated AC Odyssey's approach. It's supposed to be historical ancient Greece, and I feel just squishing a female into the protagonist role makes no sense, in ancient Greece that shit wouldn't fly. They may have been more equal for their time, but they were still sexist as fuck, a woman mercenary would have been literally impossible. To me historical fiction means ""didn't happen, but the setting and culture is historically accurate"" a woman being treated as an equal in ancient Greece takes it from historical fiction and just into fiction. And to me it's actually kinda dismissive of the IRL struggles women have endured through actual history... I compare it to making a civil war centric game that pretends slavery and racism weren't a think; it just feels like it's super dismissive of IRL struggles.

Yes, boys are given Lego while girls are given dolls. Young girls tend to want girls as friends, and all their friends are playing with dolls, so they play with dolls. That isn't to say that it's impossible some number of young girls, raised with absolutely no bias, wouldn't still prefer dolls, but there's literally *no way* to say that all of them would. To do so would be scientifically disingenuous. 

People can be convinced to do thing totally outside their nature with enough influence. This is a very well documented phenomenon. Brainwashing is a real thing, and it's not just cult stuff. If someone is raised to believe something, they're likely to continue believing it their whole life. That's why someone with Republican parents is most likely to be Republican themselves, ditto for people with Liberal parents, and people with religious parents, etc.. If you give your daughter dolls and your son computer games, and teach them nothing but that, they are going to believe in those things. 

> Saying girls are turned away from videogames is bs, because they ARE girls right now in e sports, who are really good compared to an average male gamer but to an e sport male gamer?

So let's say that one in a million men have the *potential* to be among the best in the world at a video game. Not all of them actually end up being interested in that game, or playing that game, or even knowing that game exists. Let's say a man in a first world country has a 20% chance of realizing that potential. Now imagine one in a million women also have the *potential* to be the best in the world. Considering what was discussed above, do you think they would have even close to the same chance of realizing their potential? If girls are, from birth, discouraged from playing video games as a matter of course, do you think they're likely to ever try playing the one video game they'd have the potential to be great at if they put thousands of hours of work into it? No, of course not! Multiple studies have even shown that women have a higher potential for dexterity, especially in the hands, and you'd think that would be a natural advantage! And it is, but... 

You're talking about drastically different sizes of pools of talent. You're getting the best of the best out of millions of men, but only the best of the best out of maybe tens of thousands of women. Women have additional disadvantages as well - controllers are designed for male hands and are often too big for women to use as comfortably, especially at the highest levels, women are held to higher standards, women have to endure many times the abuse if they end up in the spotlight for even a moment, AND MORE.

The intent here is to treat everyone the same. If you're a nice person, you'll treat everyone nice. If you're an asshole you'll treat everyone like an asshole. But don't see women as some non-normal creature where you need special rules.

This is also clearly what the guy understood because he replied to me ""normal is to ask for nudes"". Unless this guy is the truest pansexual of all time, he's saying he doesn't treat women like just another ""normal"" non-woman person. This has nothing to do with the fact most people are dicks, in fact I encourage assholes to be assholes to women. Being ""nice"" to women is not treating them normally if you're not normally nice.

In the normal version of the game you intentionally click on the low level monsters to level up, and take damage according to the difference between the monster's level and your level. You win by defeating all of the monsters before you run out of HP.

There's a blind mode where you start at level 0 with 1HP, so it plays more like traditional minesweeper (clicking on any monster kills you), but with the added difficulty of having to account for the levels. The huge version of that is really wild, and takes multiple hours, easily, to finish.",positive

When I have solved everything else and there is a 50/50 left (or several) you can plant a flag on one of the 2 spaces. You can have 0 flags left over and several squares unopened. Just don't ever CLICK on a mine. Always plant the flag even if you're unsure!

If it's right, you win and the non-mine space opens to show you the complete finished board. Grats!
If it's wrong, the flag stands and nothing changes. I can remove that flag and place it on the other square for victory.

If there's multiple 50/50s around the board, I just start working through the combinatorics. (1a, 2a), (1b, 2a), (1a, 2b), (2a, 2b). Eventually I'll win.",positive

* there are 40 different puzzle games if you click ""Back to main puzzles page"". And they are actually distinct, not just reskins.

* you can download native versions for Windows/Mac/Linux
* they are under active development (e.g. ""Mosaic"" is new last year)
* you can share games by ID or by seed
* most games can be controlled either by the keyboard or the mouse, to the extent possible (for games where you have to fill in a number, the keyboard is partially required; I believe ""Untangle"" is the only one that requires the mouse, although for the web version you often have to click once to capture focus regardless)

The only major downside is that, for games where you have to fill in the number, it only allows you to enter *one* set of possibilities. But that flaw is common to all but the most specialized puzzle programs.

Another, lesser, downside is that only linear undo/redo support is available. Again, support for undo trees is quite rare - I've only seen it in good text editors, never in puzzle programs (though sometimes they offer limited bifurcation and/or a manual undo/save stack).",positive

The complex part is having to look at surrounding numbers to reason your way through several possibilities, which end up being, like... ""if-then"" problems.

The mine placements are decided before you open your first spot, and the top left space is always blank in case you click a spot with a mine in it (in which case it will respawn the mine in the top left space).

If it's right, you win and the non-mine space opens to show you the complete finished board. Grats!  
If it's wrong, the flag stands and nothing changes. I can remove that flag and place it on the other square for victory.

If there's multiple 50/50s around the board, I just start working through the combinatorics. (1a, 2a), (1b, 2a), (1a, 2b), (2a, 2b). Eventually I'll win.",positive

If the flattened tile say 1, and you only have 1 raised tile touching it, it's obviously that's a bomb. But if it say 1, but you have 2 raised tile, you'll have to determine which one. Usually can figure it out based on what number is showing around it",positive
19555,"[Let's start with a more basic example.](https://minesweeper.online/img/homepage/intermediate.png)

It's worth nothing that if you click a square that has zero surrounding mines, it will automatically uncover connecting squares that also don't have bombs.  With this example, if you clicked the top right corner, it'd open up that entire empty top right area and show the numbers surrounding it.

Then it's deduction and you build from there.  For example, let's consider the section on the very far right.  That 1 in the corner must be next to exactly mine.  There is only 1 spot it can be, as out of the 8 surrounding squares, only one is not already revealed.

So you right click that corner to mark it as having a mine.  Now that you know a mine is there, all those OTHER 1s next to it are satisfied as well.  That means none of the other squares they touch can possibly be mines, so you can safely click them to see what number they hold.

There are other combos you learn to see.  Like if you are working along a straight edge and have a 1 and a 2 next to each other.  Both the 1 and 2 will have access to 3 squares each.  There will be two squares both of them touch, and one off to either side that only one or the other reach.

This means exactly one of those shared squares will contain a mine, since that's the only way the 2 can touch 2 and the 1 only touch 1.  Then you can reason there is a mine by the 2 where the 1 cannot reach, and there is not a mine to the other side of the 1 (as there must be a mine in one of the two squares they both share).

So that solved 2 of those 4 squares, and it's 50/50 on the two they both touch.  Hopefully by working more of the puzzle and working back to that spot, it'll become obvious which it is.  99% of the time that is possible, though with some versions of the game it can come down to a coin flip.",positive
19556,"The map is generated on your first click and you always click an ‚Äúempty‚Äù square (I.e. no mines in the 8 squares surrounding it). When you click an empty square it also reveals any adjoining squares that are empty until you reach a kind of border where all the squares have numbers in.

2 reasons to do this. For one, speed, as it allows you to clear the game a little faster. A less important reason is that sometimes you can be unsure at a glance if you'd flagged all the mines in an area. Chording a few numbers and seeing if anything opens up can take some mental strain away and potentially speed things up.

It's important to note that if you misflagged any adjacent mines its' game-over. If you flag too many mines chording will fail but you won't lose. If you chord a number with too few adjacent flags/none then nothing happens.",positive

The algorithm has to do a considerable amount of complex work, and it could easily take hundreds of thousands or millions of operations which will take far longer than a few quick milliseconds. Especially if you are using a language like JS which is not statically compiled.

You can go years with a good haircut and not ""feeling"" bald, or have a relatively small patch show (while actually having your hair thin out in considerable areas). Then one day you see a picture from 5 years ago and notice the gap is fucking huge and it hits you.

A full head of hair is kind of like big muscles or washboard abs or a big dick. Some guys think that their potential sexual partners demand that shit, when they often aren't even remotely a priority. Many people probably very much like those things, but the older you get the less important that shit tends to be and you realize the only thing keeping you focused on them is vanity.",negative

And it's nice to be at a spot where I'm no longer self-conscious about hairloss at the same age most of my peers are becoming really self-conscious about their hairlines and thinning hair. 

Only real advice I can give, start wearing ballcaps/bandanas in the summer sooner rather than later. First time I got sunburn on my scalp was a real motherfucker and something I would like my other bald brethren to avoid if possible.",negative
21604,"I agree, that feeling is great. I have pretty thin hairs (individually, not in terms of hair density) so when it's that short, it feels like velvet. When I was a little little kid and would get buzz cuts, my mom said she used to like to pet my head cuz it was all soft and velvety lol.",positive
21605,"Thank you for the input. And I'm sorry that seems to be their relationship. It's tough to see parents or grandparents be antagonistic towards each other. My grandparents were like that, mostly cuz my grandpa is a stubborn grumpy old man, but that all went away when my Nana's health started to decline. Now she has to live in a memory care facility because she just can't take care of herself anymore. So I'm glad that antagonistic-ness is gone, but it sucks it had to take her losing most of her memory.",positive
21606,True. I guess being short and stocky might actually be a benefit to me if I went bald. About time it had a benefit lol,positive
21607,"Fair enough on the second point. But for temperature, wouldn't a hat or even a beanie work to keep warm?",positive

21632,"Eh, cul de sac makes me think of Terry Bradshaw. It honestly doesn't look half bad on him, but he's also at an age where he can get away with it. Ymmv.

I'm a woman that's married to a man who has really pronounced balding due to genetics, so do his dad and brother. I also grew up with a dad and grandfather who both have been balding since their 30s (my kids are screwed...). 

Anyway, they all objectively cannot pull off the Mr. Clean look. It's just a head shape thing. None of them like the way they look shaved bald either. 

Hair on the sides and back, cropped close, reduces the misshapen appearance of the head. It looks bad if it grows too long though since it draws more attention to the lack of hair on top. Plus it's easy to maintain.

Properly groomed, but balding, dudes can still look sexy without going fully shaved. It's down to personal preference and what makes you feel most confident however.

Really, just being well groomed and confident overcomes like 75% of ""bad genes."" The rest is personality.",positive

It is known to accelerate hereditary hair loss, of course you dont know you were gonna lose your hair line when your a teenager, so back in 2003 when they prescribed it, they had no reason to think it would affect me in the long run.

21830,"This is a strategy which once failed for my parents one Christmas Eve.

I was given a slot car racer track, and because we were driving to the other grandparents house on Christmas day, I was told I could stay up until I crashed. The other thing to know, which properly frames the situation, is that the power distribution for a track like this is flawed. When you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.

When I went to college I studied Electrical Engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. Both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.

For the rest of the evening my Father tried in vain to knock me from the track. He used every dirty trick he could, and because of the way the cars power were distributed, it often meant I could cause his plans to backfire. I'm sure it was only a few minutes that I held on, but to a kid my age it was practically all night.",negative
