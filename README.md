# Sentiment-analysis-for-social-media-Data using Python programing language.
# Sentiment analysis on social media data involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to determine the sentiment expressed in text data gathered from social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc. The goal is to understand the opinions, attitudes, and emotions of users towards certain topics, products, events, or brands.

# Here's an overview of how we performed sentiment analysis on this project:

# Data Collection: The first step involves collecting data from social media platforms. This can be done using APIs provided by the platforms themselves or through web scraping techniques. In our case We used a Dataset from kaggle that contain comments on Gaming from reddit.

# Preprocessing: The collected data usually contains noise such as emojis, hashtags, URLs, Null values and non-standard spellings. Preprocessing involves cleaning the data by removing these elements, tokenizing the text, and converting it to a standardized format.
